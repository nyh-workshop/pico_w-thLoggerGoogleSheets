# pico_w-thLoggerGoogleSheets

This is a simple MicroPython app to log temperature and humidity using the DHT-11 sensor and Raspberry Pico W.

You must have the Google Sheets and the Google Script project ready before deploying it.

In the app, this is logged every ten minutes. This is an example (pardon the time jumps at the beginning - was briefly unplugged):

You can change the app to upload these results by any number of minutes.
